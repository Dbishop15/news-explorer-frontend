# Final project: news-explorer-frontend

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple, creating a Full-stack application "News Explorer" with pixel-perfect design and strict guidelines. This is an advanced option. We'll provide a Figma layout and an API with instructions on how to use it. Then, you'll use these resources to create a full-stack application.
