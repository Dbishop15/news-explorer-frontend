# Final project: news-explorer-frontend

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple, creating a Full-stack application "News Explorer" with pixel-perfect design and strict guidelines. This is an advanced option. We'll provide a Figma layout and an API with instructions on how to use it. Then, you'll use these resources to create a full-stack application.

## Technologies and Techniques

### Markup and JSX

- Installing CRA
- Implement the necessary routes
- Create website blocks using the toolkit with UI elements

### Connecting a Third-Party API

- Interaction with a Custom API
- Implementing requests by creating a file in the utils/ directory to work with the third-party service
- Displaying data
- Interaction with the News Explorer AP

### Make asynchronous GET and POST requests to your back end

### Protect one route with authorization

### Use the global state variable currentUser, created using createContext(), to store user data

### Embed the context in the App component via CurrentUserContext.Provider

### After receiving the authorization token from logging in, store it in localStorage
